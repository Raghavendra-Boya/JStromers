/*  
What is JS:
JS is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is primarily used for client-side scripting
on the web. It is known for its ability to add interactivity to web pages and is oft
en used in conjunction with HTML and CSS.

Key Features of JS:
- Dynamic typing: JS is dynamically typed, which means that the data type of a variable is determined
at runtime, rather than at compile time.
- First-class functions: JS functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be passed around lik
e any other variable.
-EVent-driven: User action, reaction (click,hover)
-platform independent:
- Object-oriented: JS supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, inheritanc
e, and polymorphism.
